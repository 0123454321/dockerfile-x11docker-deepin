# Known issues
 - The logout button does not respond. To terminate the session either close the X server window or type `systemctl poweroff` in terminal.
 - Configuring the keyboard input method in deepin control center does not work. Use "Fcitx Configuration" in the application menu instead.

# Extend base image
To add your desired applications, create and build from a custom Dockerfile with this image as a base. Example with `firefox`:
```
FROM x11docker/deepin
RUN apt-get update && \
    env DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y firefox && \
    apt-get clean
```

## deepin community repository
Some applications has been outsourced from the official deepin repository, noteable many Windows applications running with wine.
They should be still available in a [community repository](https://www.deepin.org/en/2020/11/19/statements/).
However, the official site is no longer accessible for unknown reasons.
An inofficial community repository outside of China is [located in Spain](https://deepinenespa√±ol.org/en/improve-the-speed-of-the-deepin-20-beta-repository/).
